## Introduction
Knowledge Graph Attention Network (KGAT) is a new recommendation framework tailored to knowledge-aware personalized recommendation. Built upon the graph neural network framework, KGAT explicitly models the high-order relations in collaborative knowledge graph to provide better recommendation with item side information.
